This is a really simple library to aid in AAA style testing. The primary driver for using this is to be able to make assertions on method calls to collaborators in actual assertions and not as part of setup.

Here is a simple example

{% highlight ruby %}
describe SomeClass do
end
  
{% endhighlight %}
